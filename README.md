# MLRPGTAVEdits
**an RPG Modification built on the FiveM framework for GTA V, several authors, edits by KingAlmond and Bucky "Bucky" Larson.

***Purpose***

We made a community called MLRP on GTA V to host a popular RPG modificaiton for GTA V based on the FiveM framework. However, we modified the framework to allow for better quality of life(QOL). 

***Technical Info***

1) In regards to QOL, we implemented some blacklisting functionality to disallow clients(players) from using vanilla GTA V mechanics and weapons. We also made a locking system for cars and added a dispatch & panic system for the police. To achieve this we utilized Lua and SQL, allowing the player to communicate to the server.
